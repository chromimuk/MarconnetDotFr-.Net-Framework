		<p>
		  Small Python program that will generates an HTML page containing all the videos from a folder. 
      Opened with Chrome, the page will make an easy-to-use interface to stream the videos to local Chomecast devices.
      <br/><br/>
      I had several interesting challenges working on it: 
      <ul>
        <li>managing a local server for the Chromecast devices to ba able to read the videos ;</li>
        <li>taking care of all the possible actions of a player (play, pause, stop, change video, restart) in a "remote" context (connection/disconnection to the device) ;</li>
        <li>generating a good and usable interface in vanilla Javascript.</li>
      </ul>
      I'm quite satisfied with the outcome of this small project: even though it's not perfect,
      I learned a lot of things doing it (and I have now a way to stream local videos to my Chromecast).
